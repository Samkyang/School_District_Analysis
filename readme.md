## Overview of the school district analysis:

##### This analysis was conducted to see the scores of the students in the school district. However after the initial analysis was completed school officials noticed that the ninth graders at Thomas High Schools cheated so I had to remove their grades and replace them with NaN (not a number).

## Results:
#### Here is an analysis of how the seven different metrics were affected when the 9th graders from Thomas High Schools grades were removed.

1. Change in number of students at Thomas High School

   a.	 ![1AB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142144024-9db6a57d-79e7-43e9-84c1-7366114df5f3.png)
   
   b. We see here when we removed the 9th grade students from total summary it brings the student count from 1635 to 1174.
   
   c. The way this was done was by setting conditions that the school name is equal to “Thomas High School” and to not count students in the 9th grade.


2.	District Summary

      a.	District Summar Before

     b.	District Summary After

     c.	There was a slight drop in the average math and reading scores which also dropped the passing percentages.

3.	School Summary

     a.	School Summary Before

     b.	school summary after

     c.	We see that after we clean up the data that Thomas High School goes from a 91% overall passing rate to a 65% passing rate.

4.	Scores by School Spending

     a.	School Spend Before
     ![School Spend Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142146202-aefc615e-b374-49d5-aa6e-27c88548e8bf.png)

     b. School Spend After

     c.	The changes in the spending per students were also affected because it is based off the average and since the 9th graders from Thomas High School were 
dropped, this changed the total amount of students which made the categories go up in passing rates.

5.	Scores by School Size

      a.	Size Before  
            ![size before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142146364-d3af5e74-8a81-4747-8430-9be38e9c843a.png)

      b.	Size After  
           ![size after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142146393-8c2cdf28-f19c-4268-940e-fe43554e2fd1.png)

      c.	Here is we can see that the totals have also changed but only by a very little because the total number of students is so large.

6.	Scores by School Type

      a.	School Type Before 
      
      ![School Type Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142146706-77014ed3-e278-45c1-bdff-b641d2d16def.png)

      b.	School Type After 
      
      ![School Type After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561003/142146721-abd3a353-9652-4a53-a78e-ceded1cd2962.png)

      c.	In the school types we can see that the average passing scores go up but the passing percentages go down because there are less students in the district. Another thing to point out is that if the totals were not shown out to the millionth and kept at whole numbers, it would look like there was no change.

## Summary:

##### The four major changes to the school district analysis after the scores have been replaced are:

1.	The total amount of students in the district. It went from 39170 to 38709

2.	The overall passing score of Thomas High School went from a 91 to a 65

3.	As the larger the sample of students grew, the smaller the effect dropping the 9th graders from Thomas High School had on the total outcome. We saw that there was a drastic change when looking at the before and after of Thomas High School, however as we looked at the School Type or even the District Summary, there was barely any change. We had to look at the thousandths decimal place in the percentage to notice any change.

4.	The effect of dropping students from Thomas High School had very little effect on the other schools because it barely shifted the overall average scores for reading and math.
